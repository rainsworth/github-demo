# [UoM Library Open Research Forum](http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/using-the-library/staff/research/open-research-forum/)

Session: Thursday, October 26 from 15:50-16:25

Speaker: [Dr. Rachael Ainsworth](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/rachael.ainsworth.html), Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, School of Physics & Astronomy, University of Manchester

## Open in order to...
...cultivate change in the culture of the astronomy (and wider research) community to be more collaborative, iterative and open which is vital in order to pursue answers to fundamental questions about our Universe and inspire the next generation of researchers in STEM.

Making research results more accessible contributes to better and more efficient science, and to innovation in the public and private sectors [[1](http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/open-science-open-access)]. Recent studies have also shown that open research practices reap benefits such as increases in citations, media attention, potential collaborators, job and funding opportunities, and brings significant benefits to researchers relative to more traditional closed practices [[2](https://elifesciences.org/articles/16800)].

### How do I practice Open Science?

* **Open Access**: I publish [my article preprints](https://arxiv.org/find/all/1/all:+AND+Ainsworth+Rachael/0/1/0/all/0/1) on the open astrophysics [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) (astronomers are pros at open access).
* **Open Data**: I publish small datasets on [GitHub](https://github.com/) (examples [here](https://github.com/rainsworth/Spectral-Energy-Distributions)) and large datasets on a server hosted by my previous institute (example [here](https://homepages.dias.ie/rainsworth/GMRT-TAU_catalogue.html)). In the future I hope to migrate these data to (and deposit data from future projects in) [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), an online repository for research outputs from across all fields of research.
* **Open Source**: I upload the codes and scripts I use to analyse my data on [GitHub](https://github.com/) (examples [here](https://github.com/rainsworth/paper_scripts)).
* **Open Science Champion**: I am working to promote, advocate and organise events relating to open science in astronomy within the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics.


### Mozilla Open Leaders :fox_face:

I am part of the current cohort of [Mozilla Open Leaders](https://mozilla.github.io/leadership-training/) where I receive mentorship and training through the Mozilla Network on a project to advance open research: [Resources for Open Science in Astronomy (ROSA)](https://github.com/rainsworth/ROSA). My project ROSA aims to collaboratively compile and tailor open science best practices from around the web into a kit for astronomers to work openly from proposal to publication. ROSA will be written for use by all research levels but its mission is to supply a single resource to early career scientists to empower them with the tools to practice open access/data/source/science! The project will also result in a general open science resource toolkit to encourage adaptation and reuse for any field of research, which can benefit all departments of the University of Manchester.


## A Friendly intro to open and collaborative research using GitHub :octocat:

A tutorial inspired by the [Mozilla Science Lab Friendly Intro to GitHub](https://github.com/mozillascience/friendly-github).

### What is GitHub?
* GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
* Open and reproducible science
   * Open source software is software that can be [freely used, modified, and shared (in both modified and unmodified form) by anyone](http://opensource.org/definition). Today the concept of "open source" is often extended beyond software, to represent a philosophy of collaboration in which working materials are made available online for anyone to fork, modify, discuss, and contribute to.
   * For more information on open source, specifically how to create and grow an open source project, GitHub have created [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/) that will help you foster a healthy open source community.


### Examples of how GitHub is used

1. Project Management
2. Websites
3. Code documentation
4. Open Educational Resources
5. Open Data
6. Online portfolio of your work
7. All the things

### Public vs Private repositories

1. Why you would work openly - public repository
2. Why/when/how you would work privately (private repositories cost ££ on GitHub, free on [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/))
    * Conference organising, manage internal discussions of keynotes etc.
    * Can have GitHub on local server; hold sensitive/commercial data here
    * 1:1 consultations
    * Gateway to openness for researchers not quite ready to open!

### Interface Tour & Jargon Busting
* **Repository** or **Repo**: a collection of documents related to your project, in which you create and save new code or content
* **Fork** - A copy of a repository on GitHub
* **Clone** - A copy of a repository on your computer
* **README** - A document that introduces an open project to the public and any potential contributors; the first thing you see in a repo; usually written in Markdown 
* **Issues** - A way to manage and assign tasks
* **Master** - The default “main” branch
* **Branch** - An alternate version of the file
* **Collaborator** vs **Contributor** - Collaborators have permission to make changes to files in your repository without your approval (they are the inner circle); anyone can be a Contributor via Pull Requests (though you don’t need to accept their contributions).


### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

### Hands-on activity

We will finish this session with a hands-on activity following the GitHub Guides [Hello-World tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) to create a repository and edit the README! :tada:
